<h2>The Hand Bandit Returns!</h2>
	<img src="images/handbone.jpg" height="650px">
<p>Local authorities today caught a rouge hand. Image above. This hand was found at the scene of the crime looting "Bargain Bin Gus." We have yet to identify the body of the hand. This is not an unusual crime - local law enforcements are well known of skeletal abilities. The use of detached limbs as a way of stealing is not a rare case, there are procedures to catch this crook</p>
